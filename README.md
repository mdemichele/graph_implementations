# graph_implementations
Here is my implementation of a directed and undirected graph ADT with Dikjstra's Algorithm.

The Project was built for CS 261 - Data Structures.

# Running the Program 
To run the program on your local machine, first clone the project.

`git clone https://github.com/mdemichele/graph_implementations.git`

There are a number of built tests for each graph type. To run the tests for the directed graph, use:

`python3 d_graph.py`

To run the tests for the undirected graph, use:

`python3 ud_graph.py`
